This project aims to test the knowledge learned by the student about Express and node to create an Inventory management app for an imaginary store, which is about music instruments.

MongoDB is the database used to store the data. Likewise, CRUD methods are implemented to allow users to manipulate the data. It should be noted that there is no authentication implemented in this project, as currently that knowledge is beyond the scope.
